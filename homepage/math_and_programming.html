        I started to like math from my 8th grade when I get moved to different school, which I have just graduated from. My math teacher when I was 8th grade was very young lady even though she doubled my age at that time. The things I learned from her was
        the fundamentals of mathematics. I really did not think that math can save the world. Actually even now, I think that is true. Math was fun because it was way far away from solving anything from real-wrold and only when trying to solve math problems and drawing I felt incredible. Like
        I am getting away from outside world and only spinning in myself, my thoughts, my memories and my feelings. I did not give fuck about what math was really used to (even though sometimes knowing the roots and usage of mathematics can be helpful) I just loved how it felt. And I did it.
        And I still do.

        Really I do not have anything to share with you about my math journey or something like that.

        To my Math A class, and my math teachers, and Munkhjargal bagsh, I love you guys.
